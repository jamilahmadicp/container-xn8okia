Since it is an Object-Oriented Programming Language So, like other Object-Oriented Languages, It can be used for Web Development. Also, itâ€™s accessible to syntax and has better readability. Django and Flask are the two most popular Python Web Frameworks.
We can use this for scientific development as it has a SciPy library, a numerical computation library NumPy, and Matplotlib, a 2D plotting library for visualization. It can install the MATLAB Engine API to interact with MATLAB as a computational engine. It is also a highly extensible language. It can use a web front end which means it is a web framework like Django, and Flask can use Python as an API with a web front end.
It is one of the most important features or areas which swings the meter in favor of Python. It can be used to create machine learning algorithms using a sci-kit library. We can build all types of models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and even more libraries like tensorflow, making it easy to create deep learning models. This popularity has risen multifold due to its use in Machine Learning and AI.
