Instead of a sequential execution, we often need to execute a specific code based on a conditional, and that's where Conditional statements are utilized in Python. It also helps in decision-making in Python, preferably when we prefer to execute a piece of code only if certain conditionals are met. In a nutshell, a conditional statement directs the order of execution of the statements mentioned as a part of it. There are different types of control statements in Python. Let's discuss those, one by one, along with Syntax and How they work.
Python conditional statement is quite useful when it comes to decision-making in programs to run a certain piece of code based on the values of the conditionals. We have numerous operators that can be used with Python conditional statements like and, or, not, etc. To evaluate these conditionals. The statements to be run must be indented by a tab else python will throw an error.
Programming as we know it is not very different from the laws of life. We always abide by certain rules, and conditions are just one of them. When programming started to get more complex new features came up. Let us suppose we have two numbers. Now initially, when we did programming, we did arithmetic operations on the two numbers to get the addition, subtraction, division, multiplication with the help of Arithmetic Operators in the desired choice of your programming language. We will start by looking at the basic structure of If Condition in Python.

Now, what if we want to ascertain which number is greater than the other? Then we certainly need to incorporate some sort of decision-making capability to the program in the form of conditional statements and with the help of Relational Operators.
