Control statements are responsible for managing the flow in which loops get executed. The order in which the specified set of statements need to be executed can be effectively governed using these control statements. the python programming language offers three major sets of statements to control the flow of the program; they are listed below
For passing through an ordered set of programming statements, the for loops are useful in python. The loop’s execution happens until the last necessary element is executed in the specified range or the mentioned condition is satisfied.
When the well-organized set of programming statements need to be executed until the condition is satisfied, then the while loops must be used. In this instance, when the condition is satisfied, the next statement call happens. as like for loop here to the body of the code is determined using the code segment’s indentation.
Break terminates the loop and passes the control to the statement after the loop. If a break statement is mentioned within a nested looping, then the control will be pulled out of the nesting’s most inner loop.
